2.2 Delayed Feedback in CVR Prediction

Methods for tackling delayed feedback in CVR prediction fall into two categories: offline batch training [2, 14, 39] and online training [17, 36, 43]. In offline learning, DFM [2] is a pioneer, using two generalized linear models: one for predicting CVR and another for estimating delay time, under the assumption of an exponential delay distribution. NoDeF [40] builds on this by representing the delay distribution without a parametric assumption, while another approach utilizes importance weighting by setting a counterfactual deadline [39]. MM-DFM [14] treats CVR prediction under delayed feedback as a multi-task learning problem, incorporating multiple conversion labels across various observation intervals. convDF and nnDF [38] address delayed feedback through convex unbiased empirical risk estimators, based on time window and stationarity assumptions. ULC [32] corrects labels for negative samples using an auxiliary model trained on artificial data with counterfactual labeling. Addressing cascade delayed feedback, ECAD [46] models delays in both conversions and refunds. In online learning, methods like FN weighted, ES-DFM, DEFER, and DEFUSE tackle delayed feedback via diverse importance sampling techniques [3, 10, 17, 36]. CBDF [43] conceptualizes the challenge as a sequential decision making problem, employing a batched bandit. FTP [19] updates its model online, guided by a prophet model trained on offline data with confirmed labels. **DFSN [51] employs two types of satellite models to maintain data freshness, allowing the incorporation of adaptive waiting windows.** **DDFM [52] consists of two unbiased CVR estimators focusing on different data sources, enabling fine-grained delayed feedback modeling.** Some methods also utilize post-click behaviors like add-to-cart to refine CVR models [29, 35, **50**]. Our paper concentrates on optimizing offline pretraining for CVR prediction without relying on post-click behaviors other than actual conversions, formulating this as an unsupervised domain adaptation problem.
